The Monitoring Plugins Project

We, the Monitoring Plugins Development Team, maintain a bundle of more than fifty standard plugins for Icinga, Naemon, Nagios, Shinken, Sensu, and other monitoring applications. Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type of check. Typically, your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine the current status of hosts and services on your network.

Some of the provided plugins let you check local system metrics (such as load averages, processes, or disk space usage), others use various network protocols (such as ICMP, SNMP, or HTTP) to perform remote checks. This allows for monitoring a large number of common host and service types. For more specific needs, thousands of community-contributed plugins can be found on sites such as Nagios Exchange or Icinga Exchange.

In addition to the core plugins bundle, we maintain a Perl module that makes it easy to write your own plugin. We also take care of an SNMP MIB used for traps sent from monitoring software. Last but not least, we host the Monitoring Plugin Development Guidelines.

Our bundle was previously known as the “official” Nagios Plugins package. The new name reflects both the success of the straightforward plugin interface originally invented by the Nagios folks, and the popularity of our package, as the plugins are now used with various other monitoring products as well.
