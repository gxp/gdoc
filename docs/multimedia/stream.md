# WaveSync

The goal is achieving a perfectly synchronised multi-room playback over the local area networks (Ethernet or Wi-Fi) using cheap components and no additional cables.

Main features:

    Wavesync receives a "combined" audio stream from PulseAudio over a Unix socket,
    chunks the audio, labels with timestamp and transmits over the network,
    then gathers chunks on receivers and plays it using PyAudio (direct ALSA, or PulseAudio output).
    It's relatively trivial to setup and doesn't have exotic dependencies.
