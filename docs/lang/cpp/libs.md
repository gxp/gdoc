# POCO

POCO (Portable Components) C++ Libraries are:

    A collection of C++ class libraries, conceptually similar to the Java Class Library or the .NET Framework.
    Focused on solutions to frequently-encountered practical problems.
    Focused on "internet-age" network-centric applications.
    Written in efficient, modern, 100% ANSI/ISO Standard C++.
    Based on and complementing the C++ Standard Library/STL.
    Highly portable and available on many different platforms, from embedded to server.
    Open Source, licensed under the Boost Software License.

# lager

lager is a C++ library to assist value-oriented design by implementing the unidirectional data-flow architecture. It is heavily inspired by Elm and Redux, and enables composable designs by promoting the use of simple value types and testable application logic via pure functions. And you get time-travel for free!

A Template Engine for Modern C++

Header-only C++17 library provides static reflection for enums, work with any enum type without any macro or boilerplate code.

    enum_cast obtains enum value from string or integer.
    enum_value returns enum value at specified index.
    enum_values obtains enum value sequence.
    enum_count returns number of enum values.
    enum_integer obtains integer value from enum value.
    enum_name returns name from enum value.
    enum_names obtains string enum name sequence.
    enum_entries obtains pair (value enum, string enum name) sequence.
    enum_index obtains index in enum value sequence from enum value.
    enum_contains checks whether enum contains enumerator with such value.
    enum_type_name returns name of enum type.
    is_unscoped_enum checks whether type is an Unscoped enumeration.
    is_scoped_enum checks whether type is an Scoped enumeration.
    underlying_type improved UB-free "SFINAE-friendly" std::underlying_type.
    ostream_operators ostream operators for enums.
    bitwise_operators bitwise operators for enums.
